# Shadow Labs

**ENCRYPTED EXECUTION FOR DEFI**

Shadow Labs builds encrypted on-chain execution products that solve real problems around MEV extraction, intent leakage, and public execution.

## Products

### StealthAuction
Encrypted end-to-end auctions using FHE. Launch tokens without losing 15-40% to MEV extraction.

### ShadowBook
Encrypted order book / dark pool. Trade with real size without signaling inventory.

### ShadowRouter
Unified encrypted execution interface. Single access point to all Shadow Labs encrypted products.

## Problem We Solve

Onchain execution is broken. Every time you place a big order, someone is watching. Your intent leaks before the tx even confirms. It feels like trading with your cards face up.

Shadow Labs products provide encrypted execution that keeps your cards hidden.
